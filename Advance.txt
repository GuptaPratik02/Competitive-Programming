 Example : 
 Solution :
# Python  
age=input(int("Age : "))
print(age);
                                                                                                                                               Maintainer : Gaurav-2803

1. You are given an integer 'N', your task is to find and return thr N'th Fibonacci Number using Matrix Exponentiation.
Solution : 
#Java
class FibonacciExample1{
public static void main(String args[])
{
 int n1=0,n2=1,n3,i,count=10;
 System.out.print(n1+" "+n2);//printing 0 and 1

 for(i=2;i<count;++i)//loop starts from 2 because 0 and 1 are already printed
 {
  n3=n1+n2;
  System.out.print(" "+n3);
  n1=n2;
  n2=n3;
 }

}}
2. Write functions that add, subtract, and multiply two numbers in their digit-list representation (and return a new digit list) using Karatsuba multiplication.
Solution :

3. Implement the following sorting algorithms: Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, Stooge Sort.
Solution :

4. Write function that translates a text to Pig Latin and back. English is translated to Pig Latin by taking the first letter of every word, moving it to the end of the word and adding ‘ay’. “The quick brown fox” becomes “Hetay uickqay rownbay oxfay”.
Solution :

5. Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1,2,…,9 (in this order) such that the result is 100. For example 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 + 78 + 9 = 100
Solution :

6. Sort array of 0s,1s and 2s in a single scan (Visiting each element once).
Solution : 

7. The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.
Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.
      I/O -> n = 4   O/P -> [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
Solution : 

8. Lexicographical order is often known as alphabetical order when dealing with strings. A string is greater than another string if it comes later in a lexicographically sorted list.
Given a word, create a new word by swapping some or all of its characters. This new word must meet two criteria:
  It must be greater than the original word
  It must be the smallest word that meets the first condition
      I/O -> abcd   O/P -> abdc  
Solution :
